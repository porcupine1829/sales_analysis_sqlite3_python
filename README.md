# Sales Analysis with SQLite and Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to import raw sales data into a SQLite database and perform a **Sales Revenue by Product** analysis using Python’s `sqlite3` module and `pandas` for data handling.

1. Create a SQLite database and define a `sales` table
2. Load JSON‐formatted sales records into that table
3. Query the database to compute total quantity sold and total revenue per product
4. Display results in tabular form and generate a bar chart visualization
